The minimum Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for a single AZ outage is 60 seconds. This is possible because RDS automatically fails over to the standby instance in another availability zone in the region. The minimum RTO for a region outage is longer as it requires manual intervention to recover using the read replica. An RTO of 15 minutes is achievable with on duty operations staff.

The minimum Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for a single AZ outage is zero seconds. The is possible because RDS syncronusly replicates data to the standby instance in the other AZ. The minimum RPO for a region outage is higher and depends on the replication lag.
